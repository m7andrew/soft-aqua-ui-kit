Soft Aqua is a UI design kit that hopes to represent the best of the Mac's skeuomorphic design history - from macOS Cheetah through macOS Mavericks. Soft Aqua is not an exact recreation of any one version of macOS, rather its goal is to reimagine what a modern skeuomorphic aqua interface could look like today. 

Named "Soft" Aqua because it borrows the soft shading effects from neomorphic design, forgoing the hard glossy highlights of Apple's original design.
